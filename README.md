An android app at which you could find interesting books, and book information

This is the first view which comes to you when you launch it:

You can search books like this:

I used some data from Douban Api V2 to implement searching and seeing more information about books.
Some more Api without which I could not do things so much like this:
OkHttp,Picasso,Gson, and hdodenhof's CircleImageView.

Thanks for visiting here.
